[_whoisthecutest_](https://whoisthecutest.netlify.com) is a blog website with the following features:

- **Blazing fast loading thanks to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to ecommerce sites to user dashboards. **_(Note: Uses Gatsby 2.0 Beta)_**

- **Customizability.** Within the "src" folder, all adaptable files to be made by the user are available. Styled with <a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">Semantic UI</a> which has great documentation and aesthetics. One can even go further to possibly add in aesthetic javascript node packages to add visuals.

- **Hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).** Netlify offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.

1. **`node_modules/`**: Location where [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) packages are installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).
2. **`public/`**: What is distributed to the viewing software so everyone can see your greatest creation!
3. **`src/`**: All development usually occurs here. “src” is a convention for “source code”.
4. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells `.git` which files it should not track nor maintain a version history for. For instance, you shouldn't let anyone get your `.env` files. (These usually contain your API keys)
5. **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.
6. **`gatsby-browser.js`**: Implements [certain APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) that the file maintains that deals with client side rendering.
7. **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more details).
8. **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customizations of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.
9. **`.gatsby-ssr.js`**: Implements [certain APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) that the file maintains that deals with server side rendering.
10. **`LICENSE`**: An open source license that protects contributors and users depending on the license chosen.
11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) projects, which includes metadata (the project’s name, author, package names, etc.). This manifest is how [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) knows which packages to install for your project.
12. **`README.md`**: A markdown file containing useful reference information about your project. The file you're reading right now!
13. **`yarn.lock`** This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your package manager dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly)
