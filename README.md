<!-- FEATURES (Gif goes right below) -->

![whoisthecutestdemo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10361542/45251420-ac795100-b2fa-11e8-9b3e-a5daae6ae74b.GIF)

[*whoisthecutest*](https://whoisthecutest.netlify.com) is a blog website with the following features:

- **Blazing fast loading thanks to [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).** Get all the benefits of static websites with none of the limitations. Gatsby sites are fully functional React apps, so you can create high-quality, dynamic web apps, from blogs to ecommerce sites to user dashboards. ***(Note: Uses Gatsby 2.0 Beta)***

- **Customizability.** Within the "src" folder, all adaptable files to be made by the user are available. Styled with <a href="https://react.semantic-ui.com/" target="_blank">Semantic UI</a> which has great documentation and aesthetics. One can even go further to possibly add in aesthetic javascript node packages to add visuals.

- **Hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).** Netlify offers both web-based and command-line interfaces in order to adapt to an extremely easy and intuitive user interface dependent on the user.

<!-- EXTERNAL SERVICES -->

<!-- ## <span role="img" aria-label="Doggo">🐕</span> Fetch information doggo! (External Services)

The project uses external services. To use them you have to secure some access data. All services are free to use or have generous free tiers big enough for a personal project.

Create an `.env` file like below in the root folder. Change `...` placeholders with your own keys.

```text
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID=...
ALGOLIA_APP_ID=...
ALGOLIA_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_ADMIN_API_KEY=...
ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME=...
```

If you wish not to use external services, simply comment out the respective sections in `gatsby-config.js`. -->

1. **`node_modules/`**: Location where [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) packages are installed via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/).
2. **`public/`**: What is distributed to the viewing software so everyone can see your greatest creation!
3. **`src/`**: All development usually occurs here. “src” is a convention for “source code”.
4. **`.gitignore`**: This file tells `.git` which files it should not track nor maintain a version history for. For instance, you shouldn't let anyone get your `.env` files. (These usually contain your API keys)
5.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.
6.  **`gatsby-browser.js`**: Implements [certain APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-apis/) that the file maintains that deals with client side rendering.
7.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you’d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more details).
8.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://next.gatsbyjs.org/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customizations of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.
9.  **`.gatsby-ssr.js`**: Implements [certain APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ssr-apis/) that the file maintains that deals with server side rendering.
10. **`LICENSE`**: An open source license that protects contributors and users depending on the license chosen.
11. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) projects, which includes metadata (the project’s name, author, package names, etc.). This manifest is how [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) knows which packages to install for your project.
12. **`README.md`**: A markdown file containing useful reference information about your project. The file you're reading right now!
13. **`yarn.lock`** This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your package manager dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly)
